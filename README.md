## Earthquake Weather: Myth or Reality?

#### Team: 
* Rona Bourdeau
* Jackie Song
* Christian Pompa

### Objective: 
We will review earthquakes from the past month as well as signifiant earthquakes in the past decade with a magnitude of 4.5+. We will use the latitude and longtitude of the earthquake to get the corresponding temperature on the day of the earthquake as well as 3 days before the earthquake. Afterwards, we will analyze if a correlation exists between the change in temperature to the occurrence of an earthquake.
