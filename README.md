## Does random changes in weather mean an Earthquake is coming?

#### Team: 
* Rona B
* Jackie Song
* Christian Pompa

### Objective: 
We will review earthquakes from all of 2019 that has a magnitude of 3.5+. We will use the Latitude and Longtitude of the earthquake to 
get historic weather data from 3 days before the earthquake up until the earthquake date. Afterwards, we will analyze weather data and look for variances and patterns relating to specific eathquake measurements.


## To-Do:
* index html template (bootstrap with resizing -- dynamic)
* d3 calls to retreive weather data within current d3 call (or better)
* analysis of data for 'box 2'
* summary of datapoint in 'box 1'

Recent Changes / Completions: 
* Flask Foundation (app.py needs: formatted for heroku & future data queries)
	* App.py works: directs to correct index & db
* database queries to store weather and earthquake data ( Review )
* database ERD ( Review )
